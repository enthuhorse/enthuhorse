I'm mostly using this as a directory for socials where people can reach out to me when I'm not avaliable. I <b>DON'T</b> post my art outside of toyhouse and the only real account(s) that I share on public is my toyhouse and twitter account. Like what I said before, make sure you check out my strawpage for a more detailed information about me. I have atabook to answer any questions you have that may be restricted by strawpage's word limit. Keep in mind that theres NSFW qnas there and flashing designs that may cause some eyestrain.
