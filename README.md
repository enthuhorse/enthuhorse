Hi, I'm Zeke. I'm mostly using this as a directory for socials where pony towners can reach out to me when I'm not playing or avaliable. I <b>DON'T</b> post my art outside of toyhouse and the only real account that I share on public is my toyhouse and twitter account. Like what I said before, make sure you check out my strawpage for a more detailed information about me. I have atabook to answer any questions you have. Keep in mind that theres NSFW qnas there and flashing designs that may cause some eyestrain.
